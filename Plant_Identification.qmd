Here is where I will have an interactive map of the locations of my iNaturalist and seek observations where you can zoom in on all of the points.


```{r}
#load in packages
library(tidyverse)
library(leaflet)
library(leaflet.extras)

#read in data
obs <- read.csv("iNat_observations/observations.csv")
```


```{r}
#some cleaning 
#first get just location by selecting just he long and lat
location <- obs |> 
  select(longitude, latitude, place_guess) |> 
  distinct()

#just the taxa name
taxon <- obs |> 
  select(iconic_taxon_name)

#just the species name
species <- obs |> 
  select(scientific_name)

```



```{r}
#create a map
```
