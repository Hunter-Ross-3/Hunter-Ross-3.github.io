Hi, I’m Hunter! I’m currently an undergraduate student at UCSB pursuing a degree in Environmental Science, which I’m excited to be earning on June 2025. When I’m not diving into my studies, you’ll often find me exploring nature on hikes, identifying different plants, experimenting in the kitchen with baking, or getting lost in a good book. Welcome!
