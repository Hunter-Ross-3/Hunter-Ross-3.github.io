![I love spending time outside hiking, camping, and slowing down enough to notice the little things. There's something special about learning the names of the plants I pass and tuning into the quiet sounds of the woods. Whether it's the rustle of leaves or the call of a bird, nature always has something to say if you are listening. Being outside helps me feel grounded, curious, and completely at peace.](hiking.JPG)

![Baking sourdough has become my weekend eitual, a process that pulls me away from schoolwork and back to my senses. And it's not just for me, I love sharing my bread with friends and family turning this process into something that brings people together. This is a photo of two of my sourdough loaves. One is plain and the other is pesto.](bread.jpg)

![Here are my two dogs, Logan on the left and Shayna on the right.My dogs are a huge part of my everyday life, constant companions with big hearts and even bigger personalities. Their presence reminds me to laugh more, worry less, and always make time for belly rubs.](dogs.jpg){width="245"}
