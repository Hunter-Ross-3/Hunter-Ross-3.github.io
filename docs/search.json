    "text": "I love spending time outside hiking, campling, and slowing down enough to notice the little things. There’s something special about learning the names og the plants I pass and tuning into the quiet sounds of the woods. Whether it’s the rustle of leaves or the call of a bird, nature always has something to say if you are listening. Being outside helps me feel grounded, curious, and completely at peace.\n\n\n\n\n\nBaking sourdough has become my weekend eitual, a process that pulls me away from schoolwork and back to my senses. And it’s not just for me, I love sharing my bread with friends and family turning this process into something that brings people together. This is a photo of two of my sourdough loaves. One is plain and the other is pesto.\n\n\n\n\n\nHere are my two dogs, Logan on the left and Shayna on the right.My dogs are a huge part of my everyday life, constant companions with big hearts and even bigger personalities. Their presence reminds me to laugh more, worry less, and always make time for belly rubs."

When I’m not diving into my studies, you’ll often find me exploring nature on hikes, identifying different plants, experimenting in the kitchen with baking, or getting lost in a good book. Welcome!"

    "text": "#| fig-cap:The circular bar graph titled \"Spending Spiral: Money Spent on Campus by Day\" visualizes the amount of money spent on campus, broken down by each day of the week. Utilizing a polar coordinate transformation of a standard bar chart, the graph presents daily spending amounts as radial segments, giving the impression of a pie or spiral chart. Each day's spending is represented with a distinct color gradient from the Viridis palette, providing clear visual separation and accessibility-friendly contrast. Notably, Thursday stands out with a dramatically larger segment than the others, clearly indicating an unusually high expenditure on that day. This spike is the result of an outlier incident when the user's tire popped, requiring an unplanned repair that cost over $30. In contrast, the segments for the other days are relatively uniform and small, reflecting more typical, lower daily spending. The use of a void theme keeps the visual clean and focused solely on the data, and the circular format adds an engaging and unconventional aesthetic while still conveying the proportional nature of the spending data.\n\n# creating circle graph\nggplot(my_data, aes(x = day, y = spent, fill = day)) + #using my original data not summary data\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", position = \n             \"dodge\", show.legend = TRUE) +\n  #creating a base bar graph\n  coord_polar() + #changing the bar graph to circle \n  theme_void() + #theme\n  scale_fill_viridis_d() +\n  labs(title = \"Spending Spiral: Money Spent on campus by Day\") +\n  # title \n  theme(title = element_text(size =14))# changing the size of title\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis project poster was from conservation planning class. This poster effectively communicates a detailed and interdisciplinary conservation strategy through a combination of scientific rigor, stakeholder engagement, and clear visual storytelling. It showcases a real-world application of environmental science and policy with both ecological and community-based lenses. The inclusion of structured planning tools like MCDA and consequence tables underscores a strong methodological foundation for decision-making."
