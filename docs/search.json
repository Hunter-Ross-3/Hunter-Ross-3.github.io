    "text": "I love spending time outside hiking, camping, and slowing down enough to notice the little things. There’s something special about learning the names of the plants I pass and tuning into the quiet sounds of the woods. Whether it’s the rustle of leaves or the call of a bird, nature always has something to say if you are listening. Being outside helps me feel grounded, curious, and completely at peace.\n\n\n\n\n\nBaking sourdough has become my weekend eitual, a process that pulls me away from schoolwork and back to my senses. And it’s not just for me, I love sharing my bread with friends and family turning this process into something that brings people together. This is a photo of two of my sourdough loaves. One is plain and the other is pesto.\n\n\n\n\n\nHere are my two dogs, Logan on the left and Shayna on the right.My dogs are a huge part of my everyday life, constant companions with big hearts and even bigger personalities. Their presence reminds me to laugh more, worry less, and always make time for belly rubs."

When I’m not diving into my studies, you’ll often find me exploring nature on hikes, identifying different plants, experimenting in the kitchen with baking, or getting lost in a good book. Welcome!"

I used a polar coordinate transformation on a regular bar chart to create a spiral-like display, where each day is represented as a distinct radial segment. I applied a Viridis color scale to make each day easy to distinguish, and I kept the overall design clean with a minimal theme so the focus stays on the data. One segment, Thursday, is noticeably larger than the others, and that’s because of an outlier: my tire popped that day, and I ended up spending over $30 to get it fixed. That unexpected cost makes Thursday look dramatically higher than the rest. Most of the other days show much smaller and more consistent spending, giving a clearer picture of my usual on-campus expenses.\n\n\n\nThis project poster was from conservation planning class. This poster effectively communicates a detailed and interdisciplinary conservation strategy through a combination of scientific rigor, stakeholder engagement, and clear visual storytelling. It showcases a real-world application of environmental science and policy with both ecological and community-based lenses. The inclusion of structured planning tools like MCDA and consequence tables underscores a strong methodological foundation for decision-making."
