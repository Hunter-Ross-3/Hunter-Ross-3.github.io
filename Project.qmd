In my circular bar graph titled "Spending Spiral: Money Spent on Campus by Day," I visualized how much money I spent on campus across different days of the week. I used a polar coordinate transformation on a regular bar chart to create a spiral-like display, where each day is represented as a distinct radial segment. I applied a Viridis color scale to make each day easy to distinguish, and I kept the overall design clean with a minimal theme so the focus stays on the data. One segment, Thursday, is noticeably larger than the others, and thatâ€™s because of an outlier: my tire popped that day, and I ended up spending over $30 to get it fixed. That unexpected cost makes Thursday look dramatically higher than the rest. Most of the other days show much smaller and more consistent spending, giving a clearer picture of my usual on-campus expenses.

This poster effectively communicates a detailed and interdisciplinary conservation strategy through a combination of scientific rigor, stakeholder engagement, and clear visual storytelling. It showcases a real-world application of environmental science and policy with both ecological and community-based lenses. The inclusion of structured planning tools like MCDA and consequence tables underscores a strong methodological foundation for decision-making.](ES 137.S2024.AlaskanGiantKelpForests.png)
